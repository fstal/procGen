# procGen
Procedurally generated terrain in Unity with realistic erosion simulation


----

## ToDo Dashboard

* Mesh Generator (Done)
* Perlin noise map (Done)
* Octaves – Overlay multiple maps (different amplitudes and frequencies) Done
* Utilize redistribution (raise height value to a power)
* Biomes (water, snow, sand, grass)
* Create island(s) – This one is a maybe
* User option to create terraces (Utilizing round, looks cool) – This one is a maybe
* Place trees (Using some other pseudo-randomness) – This one is a maybe
* Realistic erosion-based simulation to get better looking terrain – This one is a maybe
