## ToDo Dashboard

* Mesh Generator (Done)
* Perlin noise map (Done)
* Octaves – Overlay multiple maps (different amplitudes and frequencies) (Done)
* Utilize redistribution (raise height value to a power) (Done)
* Biomes (water, snow, sand, grass) (Done)
* Realistic erosion-based simulation in order to shape terrain (Done)


Future developments
* Create island(s) – This one is a maybe
* User option to create terraces (Utilizing round, looks cool) – This one is a maybe
* Place trees (Using some other pseudo-randomness) – This one is a maybe
